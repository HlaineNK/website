      <p class = "past_desc">After completing high school, I decided to take a gap year. Initially, I had no intentions of studying abroad. However, as the pandemic unfolded and universities in my country closed indefinitely, so I decided to explore opportunities overseas, and ultimately, I chose to pursue my further education in Australia.</p>
      <hr class = "navline">

      <h3 class = "past_headings">Work experience</h3>
      <p class = "past_desc">Upon arriving in Australia, I sought to connect my past experiences to my new environment. Having previously worked at a local cafe in my hometown, where I developed an appreciation and knowledge of coffee, I wanted to immerse myself in the vibrant cafe culture here. I soon found a part-time job at a local cafe. Over the past year, this job has not only been a workplace but also a community where I have formed strong bonds with my colleagues, who are very supportive and kind.
      <br></br>
      In addition to my work at the cafe, I have also done some freelance photography projects. I took photos and edited them for cafes in my hometown, focusing on the items on their menus and the ambiance of each location. These photoshoots, which included the cafe where I worked, were primarily aimed at enhancing their promotional materials.
