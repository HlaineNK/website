      <p class = "comments_desc">For my website, I aimed for both functionality and aesthetic simplicity, ensuring it is accessible and user-friendly. The site structure is pretty straightforward, composed of HTML and enhanced by CSS for styling.
      <br></br>
      In this page, I will be explaining about the technical, aesthetic and accessibility aspects of this website.
      </p>
      <hr class = "navline">
      <h3 class= "comments_heading">Technical Aspects</h3>
      <p class= "comments_desc">
        When designing this website, I followed the specifications that UTS provided. 

        The website has four HTML pages (index.html, past.html, future.html, comments.html) and a single CSS file (websystems.css).

        <br></br>
        <span>Navigation bar:</span> The website has a navigation bar on each page for easy and intuitive user movement across the website. This navigation bar is implemented using an unordered list 'ul' with list items 'li' containing hyperlinks which leads to each of the main pages. I chose none for list style to remove the default bullet points which creates a cleaner appearance. Additionally, the list is aligned to the left side, which aligns with conventional reading patterns, thus enhancing usability.

        <br></br>

        <span>Horizontal Lines:</span> To improve readability, I used horizontal lines "hr" to separate headings from paragraphs and different sections on the pages. I think this helps to break down information into manageable parts, which makes it easier for users to scan and digest. These lines serve as subtle cues to guide the reader's eye through the flow of information, enhancing the overall user experience.

        <br></br>

        <span>Images: </span>I decided to add two images in the <a href ="index.html">'Home'</a> page. The images are organized within 'div' elements with the class 'dogpic'. Each div includes an 'img' tag for displaying a photo and a 'p' tag to provide a caption. For styling them, the 'dogpic_container' is set up as a flexible box layout to ensure that the images are evenly spaced and aligned at the top of the container. 
        
        Each image is displayed as a block and is set to scale responsively to the width of its container (max-width: 100%) while maintaining its aspect ratio (height: auto). The captions under each image are centrally aligned using 'text-align: center'.

        <br></br>

        <span>Tables: </span>I also added two tables, one in this comments page and one in the <a href="past.html">'Past'</a> page. The tables are set to occupy 90% of the width, centering themselves with 'margin: 25px auto'. The 'border-collapse: collapse' property to make the adjacent cell borders merge into a single border. Each cell (td and th) is also enclosed with a 1px solid border and I added padding of 8px inside each cell to prevent the content from touching the cell borders. I also chose to alternate row colors to enhance readability. Every odd row uses a light purple color, which helps distinguish each row when scanning through data.

        <br></br>

        <span>Footer: </span> At the bottom of the webpage, I added a footer and using 'p', I added some information related to this website assignment and aligned the text to center.

      </p>

      <hr class = "navline">

      <h3 class= "comments_heading">Aesthetics</h3>
      <p class= "comments_desc">
        For the aesthetics aspect of the website, I decided to keep it clean and simple while ensuring a user-friendly experience across various pages. The overall design uses a consistent color scheme and typography that blend seamlessly to create a visually appealing and coherent look.
        <br></br>
        For the font, I chose 'Times News Roman' for headings and 'Helvetica' for body text. Times News Roman, a serif font, is used in headings to create a sense of formality and seriousness. In contrast, Helvetica's sans-serif clean lines are used in body text and captions to enhance readability, offering a contemporary feel. This font pairing not only enriches the visual experience but also helps the users in distinguishing key sections and information hierarchy effectively.
        <br></br>
        The color palette is subtle yet purposeful. I chose black for text to create maximum contrast against the light cream background, allowing ease of reading for users. For the tables, I decided to choose colors like #B7A5CC (a soft lavender) for table headers and #DDC7F5 for alternate table rows to add a touch of visual interest, making the tables not only functional but also attractive. For interactive elements such as links I chose a base color of black which transitions to #C08CFF upon hover, providing immediate visual feedback to users and enhancing the interactive experience of the site.
        <br></br>
        
        Using centered text for main headings and center-aligned paragraphs helps to keep the layout balanced and focused, making it easier for users to follow along.
        
        I also used plenty of white space around text and images to keep each page clean and uncluttered, making it more welcoming and easier to get around. 
      </p>

      <hr class = "navline">

      <h3 class= "comments_heading">Accessibility</h3>
      <p class= "comments_desc">
        To ensure all the text is readable for users with visual impairments, I used high-contrast color combinations, such as black text on a light background. I also used web-safe fonts like Helvetica and Times News Roman to aid readability. For the body, I chose a sans-serif font since it is easier to read compared to serif fonts which have decorative lines which can make it difficult for some users to read.
        <br></br>
        All images throughout the website include descriptive alt attributes. These descriptions provide context for users who cannot see the images, ensuring that the information of the images is still accessible.
        <br></br>
        To further enhance readability, the headings and body text has different font family and font weight. Headings are styled with a bolder font weight compared to the lighter weight of the body text, providing a visual hierarchy that helps users easily distinguish between sections and navigate the content more effectively.
