        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p class = "future_desc">
          This year I am trying to get myself a new film camera to bring along with me to all my travels. I have been saving some money for this and I have been doing my research on various film camera models to find the perfect match that suits my aesthetic and functional needs. 

          <br></br>

          For post-graduation, my first plan is to reunite with my family. We have planned to travel together, exploring a few countries and immersing ourselves in different cultures. There are a bunch of countries on my list  but I think I want Japan to be the first place I travel to. I also want to bring my film camera along with me, so I can want to capture the beauty of each destination, develop my portfolio and share these adventures through my lens.
          
          <br></br>

          I'm also exploring the possibility of extending my stay here with a temporary graduate visa, which would allow me to further my career in Australia. This opportunity could significantly broaden my career prospects, allowing me to gain more experience and potentially contribute to exciting projects here.
