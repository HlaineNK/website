      Hello! My name is Hlaine Nadi Khant and this is my website submission for
      the Web Systems assignment. I am currently doing a Bachelor of Computing
      Science at UTS. I have a dog named Jackie back at my home country whom I
      miss a lot and haven't seen him for over a year. So, hopefully I can go
      visit home and see him this year and below are some photos of him.

    <h3 class="hobbyHeading">Photography</h3>
    <p class="hobbyDesc">
      I started taking interest in photography around 2019, initially using my
      phone to take photos. By 2020, I had saved enough to buy a digital camera
      but later, my focus shifted to film photography. Ever since I got to
      Sydney, I have been enjoying taking film photos especially in black and
      white.
    </p>

    <h3 class="hobbyHeading">Drawing</h3>
    <p class="hobbyDesc">
      Another thing I like to do during my downtime is to draw. I picked up
      drawing around 2020 during the pandemic where I taught myself through
      YouTube videos, focusing mainly on portraits.
    </p>

    <h3 class="hobbyHeading">Movies</h3>
    <p class="hobbyDesc">
      As someone who likes photography, I also enjoy watching movies. Sometimes,
      I enjoy watching movies with friends and one of my favorites from recent
      watches would be Dune: Part Two. Additionally, I find myself drawn to
      animated movies, especially those produced by
      <a href="https://www.studioghibli.com.au/">Studio Ghibli</a>.
